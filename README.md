A not-so-simple card game about some dudes dueling each other. Infuses characteristics of traditional collectible card games with a deckbuilder playstyle.

Rules can be found in the Wiki page, or in the rules file.

Currently intended for physical gamespace. I may develop a digital version if and when I'm competent.
