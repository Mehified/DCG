# DCG
A not-so-simple card game about some dudes dueling each other. Infuses characteristics of traditional collectible card games with a deckbuilder playstyle.

Rules can be found in the Wiki page, or in the rules file.

Files here may be used to print cards using nanDECK. You may print them or use Tabletop Simulator to play the game.

Currently intended for physical gamespace. I may develop a digital version if and when I'm competent.
